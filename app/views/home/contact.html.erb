<p>	<%= image_tag 'yodeling_veterinarian.jpg', :class => "left" %>Unfortunately, the Pittsburgh 
	Animal Treatment Services is not a real veterinarian website, but rather a 
	sample project for programming students at Carnegie Mellon University. We 
	are sure that you wanted treatment for your pets from the most exquisite 
	veterinarians on the planet, but that's how it goes sometimes.  If you are 
	bitterly disappointed (and quite honestly, you should be) and want to 
	grouse to someone, here's the contact info:</p>

<p class="note"><br>*I am a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon 
	University and this nickname was a little running joke between myself and my 
	students that I adopted as my signature for all my programming work.
